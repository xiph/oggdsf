Information for builds after 0.71
=================================

This project now uses VS2005. VS2003/2002/6.0 will *not*
 be able to open or build this project.

This also means it uses V8.0 of the run time libraries.
Depending if i have suppressed the warnings, you may
see lots of compiler warnings about things in the C
library being deprecated. As of V8.0 most of the standard
C library is marked deprecated and it is recommended to
use new and semantically different functions from the new
secure CRT. Since there are so many of these occurences,
and some of the code needs to be portable, these warnings
are mostly suppressed/ignored.

In order to fix unicode problems on modern systems without
 dropping support for 9X/ME machines, a custom built
 C runtime needs to be used. These are in the repository
 in the bin directory. You need to overwrite some of your
 Visual Studio files to build the version that can run
 on the old versions. At this stage i haven't checked
 whether it is now unbuildable without doing this (i don't
 think it will be, just you will get a binary that only
 works on NT/2K/XP systems)

(More info to come on this)  

You need to set up several things in your build environment
 in order to build this project. It depends on several
 Microsoft SDK's. Without these you cannot build this
 project.

The directshow SDK is now part of the core platforms SDK.
 You will need this as well as the DirectX SDK.

There are no longer hardcoded paths into the directx sdk,
 all the projects now use the environment variables that
 are created by installing the SDK's.

The main solution is in \sln\oggdsf_all

Some projects in the solution may not build. You should
 build the distribution project called oggcodecs, to
 ensure you are build all and only the projects that are
 part of the core distribution. VS Express, may or may not
 properly handle distribution project.

If you are using the distribution project from the IDE
 it is important that before you
 install using that installer, that you uninstall any
 version of the official distribution. Similarly, if
 you are going to install the official distribution
 after you have used this feature, you need to unistall
 the official distribution.
 They use two different installer technologies, and each
  will install over the other without the other one
  knowing.

In order to build you need the following
 * Visual Studio 2005 - I develop and test with the professional
    edition. This is the recommended way to build.

    It should/may also be possible to build with the
    free Express edition. To build the directshow filters
    core package, you'll need VC++ 2005 Express. Other
    projects not part of the core distribution are in C#
    so if you want to be able to open every project in the
    solution you will also need this. I have not tested
    using the express edition yet. If you try and it works
    let me know, or tell me anything special you had to do.

    You can download express edition for free from
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx

    
 * Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK - Yes, even if you
    are using XP or whatever operating system.

    You can download it from (~400MB, getting the disk image is easiest)
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en

   You will need to update the build paths in VS2005, whether
    you use express or the full version. The following link explains
    how to do that (see step 3). If using express, you will need
    to follow all the steps on this link.

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

   See step 3. 

   eg. in the Executable files list *at the top* of the list
    ad $(MSSdk)\Bin and in the include list $(MSSdk)\include
   They must be at the top (or at least above the other
    references to the built in platform sdk), 
    otherwise the compiler will
    still use the old version it came with.

   In the installer there is one item not checked at the top
    This option adds the MSSdk environment variable. It
    warns this could affect other programs that use older
    versions of the platform sdk. It caused no problem for
    me, but if you have development projects depending 
    on this variable and/or older versions of the platform
    SDK, you'll have to work out what works for you. That
    warning is pretty big and bold.

   If you don't take this option, you'll need to hardcode in
    the path you installed the platform sdk to as it does
    suggest in step 3 of the link above, however this still
    changes VS's global settings could also cause problems.

   Alternatively, if you don't take this option, and later 
    realise that this issue will not affect you, you can
    add the MSSdk user and system variable yourself if you
    choose.

   Hardcoding the path will force VS to always use this
    version, and you'll have to update it if a new one
    comes out. Using the environment variable will cause
    it to always use the latest version (really whatever version
    the variable points to). Each option has it's ups and
    downs, depending on what other development work you do.

   Also note: That big bold warning says you can register with
    visual studio by using a link in the start menu. This
    *does not* work for VS2005. The platform SDK was released
    before VS2005, it's probably updating the build paths
    in vs2003. This is the reason you have to manaully update
    the paths in options. It's likely when a new platform
    SDK is released it will work properly for VS2005.
   

   You mileage mary vary if you have the express edition.

 * DirectX SDK February 2006 (or probably later will work too)

    You can download it from (~350MB, validation required)
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=EDB98FFA-A59C-4C23-9B92-BA304F188314&displaylang=en

    You will also need to add to your include paths in
     Visual Studio the path to the DX include files.
    This DX SDK creates the environment variable DXSDK_DIR

    So you need to add to the include list (as you did above)
    $(DXSDK_DIR)include

 * WMP 10 SDK - At this time not required, but may be by
    the time you read this if i forget to update this doc.
    I'll try to remember!

   You can download from here
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsmedia/downloads/default.aspx

 * NASM 0.98.38/0.98.39 - This is required for flac. Best to
    install it to it's default at C:\NASM.

   You can download from here
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm

 * Windows Mobile 5.0 Developer Resource Kit (~900MB)
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3BAA5B7D-04C1-4EC2-83DC-61B21EC5FE57&displaylang=en

   The express edition can not do mobile development.
   I have no idea whether it will let you open the project
    and ignore the mobile configurations or whether
    it will just refuse to let you. I'm not sure if
    the professional edition will even let you open the
    projects which have wm5 configs (most of them)
    without installing this.



You need all these things if you want to build this project.
 If you already do directx/multimedia development you may already
 have some or all of these sdk's. You only need them once to setup
 your build environment.

It may seem excessive that you need to download 2 gigabytes of stuff
 just to build. This project uses technologies from several sdk's, 
 and there is no way around that. Once you set up these things, the
 project is very easy to build, with the professional edition and
 above that is, possibly the standard edition. 

The baseclasses library is no longer used from the platform
 SDK (but you still need it). There is a modified version
 of the baseclasses libraries that is part of this source.
 The version in the platform SDK won't build in VS2005 as it
 is, the modifed version that is part of this source has
 fixes so that it builds correctly with the new compiler.

This project now uses V8 of the runtime libraries. As of
 version 8, there are changes to the way the operating system
 handles these libraries. The first release to use this is/will be
 0.72.xxxx

The release distributions are built using NSIS. There is
 an MSI installer project in the solution, this is only
 for developer convenience. It is often not fully up to
 date, and/or correct. It should *never* be used as a means
 of distribution.

The below information is left for reference, where the

These are probably not very build friendly at the moment.
I will make them a bit more user friendly in the future.


In order to build these...


You need visual studio 2003. There are no VC6 files or VS2002 files.
 In theory you should be able to create VC2002 files... and in fact
 out of date VC2002 files are generally found with .vcproj.bak 
 extensions. However some of the libraries will not build in VS2002,
 there is a bug in the 2002 compilers imlpementation of mixed mode
 dlls, which stops some of the .NET bridging libraries linking.

You need NASM for FLAC to build. (lifes easier if it's at C:\NASM)
 you'll have to play around with that yourself... it's a real pain !
 Also the vcproj files have hidden settings that don't show up
 in visual studio... you'll have to figure it out (ie edit the vcproj)
 I suggest once you get it to build, leave it built... don't clean
 that project. The clean script it has for some reason tries to
 delete some necessary header files. Don't ask me why !
 Also ignore visual studio hassling you about sourcesafe for flac.

I've been using NASM 0.98.38 which you can find here
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm You want the win32 binaries.

If you do accidentally clean FLAC, you will get a message when you
 try to build that says "ordinals.h" not found. You need to
 go to the libFLAC directory and find the file called ordinals.h.bak
 and *copy* it to the same directory without the .in extension.
 Don't just rename it... you want to keep that file for next time
 this happens !

You need DirectX 9 SDK installed (lifes easier if it's at C:\DXSDK)
 Otherwise all projects prefixed with dsf you'll need to change the
 absolute references to that path. I'll try to do something to make
 this easier in future.
 
If the baseclasses project shows up as not found, you need to find
 it in the DXSDK directory tree, and load it from there.
 By default it tries to build against Multithreaded static runtimes
 You *must* change these to Multi Threaded DLL or Multi Threaded 
 debug DLL. Otherwise all sorts of chaos will occur. This project
 is not part of the package. It is part of the DirectX SDK.

If you try to build the installer project, you need to change the paths
 of the AUTHORS, COPYRIGHTS etc files... i can't make it accept a
 relative path.

Probably other stuff i can't think of. These aren't really ready for
 easy use yet.
