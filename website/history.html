<b><u><font size="+2">History of Directshow Filters for Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora and FLAC</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="+1">History</font></u></b><br>
I first began working on ogg media directshow filters whilst under contract to CSIRO's <a href="http://www.annodex.net">annodex.net</a> project group. Much of the knowledge I needed to write these filters was gained through my work with this project.My initial implementation was for a specific annodex (which uses the ogg encapsulation format)demuxer. Part of my aim of this project was to use the knowledge gained to create a set of filters that works with generic ogg physical streams rather than just a particular physical bitstream format and to release these back to the open source community. There were several limitations to the approach taken to the original annodex filters which is why I decided to start from scratch to design the filter architecture over again with the experience of the first attempt.<br>
<br>
Another of my aims of this project is to rewrite the annodex demuxer to use this new design in order for it to be more extensible and easier to work with. This time writing the generic ogg case first and then basing the annodex demuxer on this new design it will increase the consistency of the code between the two modules and provide less trouble integrating new codecs, with the aim of making annodex technology available in the standard applications that come default with windows.<br>
<br>
I encourage you all to go and check out the <a href="http://www.annodex.net">annodex project</a> and to consider coding some applications to utilise this new technology. There are many interesting posibilities this new technology presents to continuous media and search technology which will expand the internet to be a richer more dynamic multimedia experience.<br>
<br>
Thankyou to CSIRO's annodex.net project group (Silvia Pfeiffer, Conrad Parker and André Pang) for the opportunity to work on this exciting new technology and sparking my interest in directshow and the <a href="http://xiph.org">xiph.org</a> range of codecs.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the 1st of May 2004, this project began to be maintained in the <a href="http://www.xiph.org">xiph.org</a> subversion repository. It can be found at <a href="http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/">svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/</a><br>

<b><u>Previous Version (0.61.7571) - 16/08/2004</u></b><br>
To stop people unnecessarily downloading the windows installer over and over, the packages will no longer include the installer. If you have a pre-XP 
windows, and don't already have the windows installer on your system (almost everyone who has ever installed something should have it already) you can
download the installer seperately from the links at the top of the page.<br>
<br>
Fixed a few bugs in theora, seeking almost never crashes now. FLAC playback and seeking now works properly, though not extensively tested. Includes a FLAC encoder filter. Starting from the
next release I will start offering different build configurations, ie minimal decode only installation, builds with SSE2 optimisations etc.<br>

<b><u>Changes this version</u></b><br>
	<li>Fixed seeking crash problems with theora</li>
	<li>Fixed FLAC playback</li>
	<li>Added a FLAC encoder filter</li>
	<li>Added a very simple .NET media player called DNPlay</li>
	<li>Added a .NET directshow playback library</li>
	<li>Added a validation program for ogg files OOOggValidate</li>
<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.60.7043) - 08/07/2004</u></b><br>
Quite a fair bit added this time, most notably an encoder for theora... see <a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/enc_theora_graphedit.html">Encoding theora</a><br>
Only a few encoding parameters are currently exposed via a filter property page. Also modified the demuxer so it can handle http streams though there are some issues. The buffering is very simple, it doesn't optimise buffer based on bandwidth. Network steams are currently non-seekable. Also only non-chained
files should be streamed. Most encoded files are not chained. However some icecast streams, Which are not continuous, have breaks where songs change, this type of stream will likely crash the media player. However continuous live streams... such as radio broadcasts etc generally work fine. The network streaming has only recently be added, so i expect it to still be fairly buggy.<br>
<br>
To all the people interested in FLAC, I will be spending some time sorting out the bugs that have been there for ages very soon, thanks for your patience !<br>
<br>
This release has a lot of new code added, I'd really appreciate feedback on the installation process, and the encoding. I will leave the links to the previous version up for a while further down the page.<br>

<br>
	<li>Added <a href="http://www.annodex.net/TR/draft-pfeiffer-cmml-01.html">CMML</a> Decoder filter</li>
	<li>Added a simple subtitle renderer based on VMR 9</li>

<b><u>Previous Version (0.57.6744) - 22/05/2004</u></b><br>
Previous release a few hours ago had hundreds of debug statements in the release build. It may have created log files in your C:\ Root directory as well as C:\temp and possibly in G:\ if you have a writable G drive. Sorry if you got this a few hours ago.
<br>
	<li>Removed a whole heap of debugging code.</li>

<b><u>Previous Version (0.56.6741) - 21/05/2004</u></b><br>
Most of the changes in this build are internal modifications to better deal with the need to determine start times of all samples in order to properly synchronise multi-stream files. The main externally visible change is the limited ability to seek in theora files without total loss of synch. There are still a few issues to be ironed out though.
<br>
	<li>Modified internal timestamping mechanism, to allow resynch easier in theora.</li>
	<li>Now able to seek in theora (not to keyframe), but occasionally crashes after seek.</li>
	<li>Speex and vorbis, don't have seg fault any more, though very rarely after a seek there is no audio. Another seek fixes it.</li>
	<li>Added simple new tool called OOOggStat, to give info on contained streams.</li>

<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.55.0115) - 27/04/2004</u></b><br>
Vorbis and speex playback are now pretty much finished bar the very rare bug I mention below. I've played dozens of speex and vorbis files and they all seem just fine. Pretty much fully functional.<br>
The track duration shows up incorrectly in all codecs besides speex and vorbis because I haven't coded it yet !<br>
A seek table is built as the file is loaded... this is currently done by basicly processing the entire file... so there may be a small delay loading large files. When I get time I'll replace this with a better method that doesn't try and process the entire file, but can skip through to the relevant parts.<br>
	<li>NOTE: I suggest you don't distribute files encoded with these codecs yet... there may still be problems with them</li>
	<li>Fixed clumpy playback of divx, bad timestamping</li>
	<li>Added seeking, duration and position info to vorbis and speex</li>
	<li>Fixed a few internal errors with regards to timestamping</li>
	<li>Added a seek table for rapid seeking</li>
<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.52.0093) - 18/04/2004</u></b><br>
	<li>NOTE: I suggest you don't distribute files encoded with these codecs yet... there may still be problems with them</li>
	<li>See version 0.50.0090 for information</li>
	<li>Now checksums pages properly.</li>
	<li>Properly organises initial header packets in pages.</li>
	

<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.51.0092) - 18/04/2004</u></b><br>
	<li>See version 0.50.0090 for information</li>
	<li>Stuffed up some packaging and linking in the last version... probably won't affect it, but just to be safe, did rebuild and package. Sorry if you got it 5 minutes ago !</li>
	
<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.50.0090) - 18/04/2004</u></b><br>
Start of encoding support has been added... see <a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/graphedit.html">example filter graphs</a>. Use graphedit (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9216652f-51e0-402e-b7b5-feb68d00f298&displaylang=en">DirectX9 SDK</a>)</li>
	<li>Added support for OGM style video encapsulation *decode only*, requires <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow">ffdshow</a>. Should recognise any format ffdshow can handle. (Video quite clumpy at the moment)</li>
	<li>Added single stream Ogg Muxer... for muxing theora, speex and vorbis</li>
	<li>Added vorbis encoder filter</li>
	<li>Added speex encoder filter</li>
	<li>Included Abstract Audio Encoder library</li>
	
<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.40.0069) - 08/04/2004</u></b><br>
This new release completes the basic functionality for the four major codecs, though there are still bugs. Theora hasn't been extensively tested
as I don't have many test files to work with. FLAC is still pretty buggy... theora less so... but still buggy.
	<li>NOTE: Untested with DirectX 8 or lower. I'm pretty sure theora will only play with DX9. Others *should* work with DX8.</li>
	<li>Added basic Theora support (alpha 3 *only*, previous bitstream formats are depracated). See issues below.</li>
	<li>Included OO Theora wrapper library</li>
	<li>Included Abstract Video Decoder library</li>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Previous Version (0.30.0058) - 31/03/2004</u></b><br>
Just thought I'd release this update. It includes some FLAC support but it's very buggy, I suggest you don't use FLAC just yet.<br>
Vorbis and speex are the same as before but with below changes. Vorbis and Speex won't crash<br>
	<li>Fixed bug in stream recogniser which defaulted unknown to speex.</li>
	<li>Fixed minor defect in audio when stopping and replaying</li>
	<li>Split Vorbis and Speex to seperate filters</li>
	<li>Included Abstract Codec Library</li>
	<li>Now ignores unknown streams. ie. Playing a theora/vorbis will only play the vorbis</li>
	<li>Major abstractions to demux filter in preperation for theora/annodex</li>
	<li>Included very basic Ogg FLAC playback (very buggy, see below, update in a day or two to fix)</li>
	<li>Included one of my basic debugging tools. OOOggDump. Usage : OOOggDump filename, be sure to redirect output to a file</li>
<br>
