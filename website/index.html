<br>
This is a temporary page until I get time to do a proper one. I really will get around to it someday soon ! I made a token effort to tidy it up !<br>
<br>
Please contact me at ogg@illiminable.com with new bugs or suggestions. Help me, help you. If you don't tell me, I'll never know !!<br>
<br>
<b><u>Installation</u></b><br>
<li>Uninstall any previous version of these filters. Go to add remove programs, remove oggcodecs</li>
<li>Make sure media player or any directshow applications are closed.</li>
<li><b>Important: Non-XP Windows -</b> You need the Microsoft installer before you can install this package, most systems already have it. If the setup package won't run, download the Microsoft installer from the links below and run the setup package again.</li>
	<li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/WindowsInstaller/Install/2.0/W9XMe/EN-US/InstMsiA.exe">98, ME Microsoft Installer download</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/WindowsInstaller/Install/2.0/NT45/EN-US/InstMsiW.exe">NT, 2K Microsoft Installer download</a></li>

<li>Unzip the setup package(download below) to a temp directory then run setup.</li>
<br>
Then media player or any other directshow application (ie BSPlayer) will be able to play Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora and Ogg FLAC.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Other stuff</u></b><br>
<li>Also you can encode vorbis, speex, FLAC and theora files using graphedit(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9216652f-51e0-402e-b7b5-feb68d00f298&displaylang=en">DirectX9 SDK</a>) or other similar program.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/graphedit.html">See audio encoding example filter graphs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/enc_theora_graphedit.html">Theora encoding how-to</a></li>
<li>If you install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow">ffdshow</a>, you will be able to play ogm style *video only* files (ie OGM\DivX in one stream and non-OGM vorbis in the other).</li>
<li>Also, if you download, install and register <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84799">Gabests .cda directshow source</a> you can rip CD's using graphedit</li>
<li>Looking for <a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/history.html">old versions</a> ?</li>
<li>Want the <a href="http://www.illiminable.com/ogg/oggcodecs_src_0.61.7571.zip">zipped source code</a> (7 MB zipped, 25MB unzipped) ?</li>
<li>Want to <a href="http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/">browse the source on the web</a> </li>
<br>
<b><u>Current Version (0.61.7571) - 16/08/2004</u></b><br>
To stop people unnecessarily downloading the windows installer over and over, the packages will no longer include the installer. If you have a pre-XP 
windows, and don't already have the windows installer on your system (almost everyone who has ever installed something should have it already) you can
download the installer seperately from the links at the top of the page.<br>
<br>
Fixed a few bugs in theora, seeking almost never crashes now. FLAC playback and seeking now works properly, though not extensively tested. Includes a FLAC encoder filter. Starting from the
next release I will start offering different build configurations, ie minimal decode only installation, builds with SSE2 optimisations etc.<br>

<b><u>Changes this version</u></b><br>
	<li>Fixed seeking crash problems with theora</li>
	<li>Fixed FLAC playback</li>
	<li>Added a FLAC encoder filter</li>
	<li>Added a very simple .NET media player called DNPlay</li>
	<li>Added a .NET directshow playback library</li>
	<li>Added a validation program for ogg files OOOggValidate</li>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Known issues.</u></b><br>
	<li>Muxer creates broken files when packets are very large (usually high quality theora)</li>
	<li>I've been told that the installer tries to force you to install .NET if you don't already have it... the filters don't need .NET, it's only for the example player application. The next version will fix this installation problem</li>
	<li>FLAC seems to lose the first 1/2 second of audio if you stop then play again</li>
	<li>Realised I broke the limited network streaming the previous version had. Don't try and stream anything. This is already resolved and will be in the next version coming soon.</li>
	<li>Seeking is slightly less responsive in this latest version. Most noticable in speex.</li>
	<li>Seeking very close to the end of speex or vorbis files, causes all audio to cease, requiring stop/play to resolve. Particularly noticable in small files, seems roughly 5 secs from end where this occurs.</li>
	<li>There is no way to alter the audio encoding parameters, vorbis defaults to quality 0.3</li>
	<li>When transcoding theora, if a media decoder (WMV usually) doesn't advertise its framerate, output may be time distorted</li>
	<li>Created files are not yet gauranteed to be correct. <b>No produced encoded files should be distributed.</b></li>
	<li>I think there may be a little memory leak in the encoders... nothing too serious, but if you try and encode really large files it may be a problem.</li>
	<li>Theora will not playback with Windows Media Player 9 or 10, but vorbis, speex and FLAC are just fine, but will in previous WMP's and other DS players like BSPlayer</li>
	<li>Theora and annodex playback requires directX 9.</li>
	<li>CMML decoding requires MSXML3.dll to be present. (it was installed with IE6)</li>
	<li>Only plays Ogg encapsulated FLAC. Won't play normal FLAC files.</li>
	<li><strike>Duration is wrong for all files except speex, vorbis and theora... doesn't affect playback</strike></li>
	<li><strike>Seeking in theora occasionally seg faults</strike></li>	
	<li><strike>Only plays FLAC with 16 bit 2 channel 44100Hz settings. Still hardcoded.</strike></li>
	<li><strike>FLAC will make media player do the error sound or crash on exit</strike></li>
	<li><strike>DON'T try to stop a FLAC stream. It crashes. Running to the end is ok.</strike></li>
