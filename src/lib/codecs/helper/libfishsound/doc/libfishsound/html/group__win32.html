<div class="fragment"><pre>The /Win32 directory contains everything necessary to compile
libfishsound under windows and create:

- libfishsound.dll
- identify.exe
- encode.exe
- decode.exe

Building with the Makefile
==========================

Here's what you need to <span class="keywordflow">do</span>:

1) Install libogg.dll, libvorbis.dll, and libspeex.dll.
   (you can get them from http:<span class="comment">//www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ </span>
    and http:<span class="comment">//www.speex.org/ ). encode and decode will</span>
   additionally require libsndfile to be installed (see
   http:<span class="comment">//www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).</span>

2) cd win32 subdirectory

3) Use <span class="stringliteral">"nmake"</span> to create library and executable.

4) Install libfishsound.dll and the include files from the
   /include/fishsound/ directory.

5) You can test the library with the <span class="stringliteral">"identify.exe"</span> program
   also found in the win32 subdirectory.


Visual Studio.NET 2003 Installation
===================================
NOTE: For lack of platform, we were not able to keep the solution
files up-to-date. Please use the Visual Studio Version 6 files
instead or send us an updated version <span class="keywordflow">if</span> you're <span class="keyword">using</span> these.


IMPORTANT: The solution files were built <span class="keywordflow">for</span> VS.NET 2003 and can't be
opened by VS.NET 2002. If you use VS.NET 2002 you should use the VS6
workspace files and they will be automatically converted to the <span class="keyword">new</span>
format.

Also included in the solution is a setup and deployment project that
will <span class="keyword">package </span>and create an installer for the binary output of this
project.

You will need to install the libogg, libvoribs, and libspeex libraries
separately. If you wish to create a debug build and wish to have the
debugger load the symbols for these libraries, you should also include
their project source files. By default the compiler and linker will
look for them in the same parent directory as libfishsound. However
you can install them wherever you choose and must modify the include
directories for the linker and compiler in your projects properties.


Visual Studio Version 6 Installation
====================================

There is also a Visual C++ V 6.0 workspace file in the Win32 directory
in case you have not upgraded to Visual Studio.NET.
