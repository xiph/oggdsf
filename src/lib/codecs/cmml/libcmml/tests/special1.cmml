effects of this pollution of the atmosphere include damage to the ozone layer</a>

Air pollution is everywhere.  Pouring out of car exhausts,
      factories and from burnoffs. Most monitoring of air pollution is
      conducted outside, but statistics show in fact that Australians
      spend 95 per cent of their time inside... and this is where
      pollutants could be silently causing problems.

Dr. Tom Beer, a CSIRO scientist, from the Division of
      Atmospheric Research, was interested in discovering what the
      most heavily polluted areas he encountered during a normal day
      were. So he devised a personal air pollution sampler which he
      wore for 20 weeks during his normal day to day activities.

He found from his sampler that nitrogen dioxide, which
     forms whenever fossil fuels such as natural gas or petrol burn,
     read at 16 parts per billion outside on a normal busy street. And
     as soon as he went inside his home, the reading dropped to 12
     parts per billion. However in the kitchen, where there is a gas
     stove, the reading leapt to 32 parts per billion, twice the
     reading outside the house.

DR. Tom Beer, CSIRO: "I see these being used in any
      situation where workers may be exposed to nitrogen dioxide and
      typical examples of that would be chefs working in an industrial
      kitchen, or workers in factories that have gas fired boilers. We
      have similar passive gas samplers that can measure ozone, that
      can measure sulphur dioxide, that can measure formaldehyde."

There are currently two thousand samplers being worn
      around the world. The information collected from these will be
      used by environmental managers to ensure that we have clean air
      inside as well as outside.
