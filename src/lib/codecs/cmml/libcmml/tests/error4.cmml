Modern living means fast transportation, rapid
      communications and heat, light and power at the flick of a
      switch. But it doesn't come without cost... and one of the
      highest costs is pollution. One of the worse offenders used to
      be coal fired power stations, but with government's tight
      environmental laws, and scientific research, stations like this
      one at Eraring in New South Wales are leaving the skies almost
      spotless.
