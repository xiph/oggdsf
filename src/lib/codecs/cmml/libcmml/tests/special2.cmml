A way we can store water so that water supplies will not be stressed during hot dry periods</a>
<desc>
Urban water usage research:
Australia is a dry continent and urban communities use a
     lot of the available water. CSIRO has been working on an urban
     water program. The objective is to find out how much water use is
     costing the environment and what are the opportunities to improve
     its use. Mike Young from CSIRO Land and Water believes we take
     water for granted.

Mike Young: "Something which we all see: we turn on a tap
     let it flow out without thinking through what happens when we
     do. Important things like think about how wide a street should
     be. If you have a wide street out going past your house you have
     a lot more run-off and that run-off flows actually though changes
     all of the ground-water systems and can cause lots of
     pollution. Changing the way these streets are laid out, the way
     they're designed can bring about some pretty important
     improvements in water use."

Question: "Should we be looking at alternatives to
     centralised treatment systems?"

Mike Young: "A lovely example of the alternative approach
     is in South Australia and Adelaide at Morthorn Lakes where the
     community is moving towards a system where every house
     has actually two pipes coming in. One is the fresh water that is
     being treated in the normal way. The second is recycled
     water. And the quality of that is very very good. It can be used
     for flushing toilets, for watering gardens, and a lot of the
     things that we normally pay a lot to get clean water
     for. Changing the way we think about water and how we actually
     use it is an important step forward. We don't have a lot of it in
     Australia. And as we've said in the past we are taking it for
     granted and we shouldn't."

Question: "Does storm water have an economic value?"

<clip id="Mike_Young_Answer2" start="npt:00:03:18.20">

Mike Young: "The economic side of which, which actually
     fascinates me, is that people in the past thought the storm water
     wasn't a useful resource. And suddenly people are finding that it
     has actually value and they're starting to hold it and claim it
     as theirs. With tradeable water taken into the equation and with
     high water prices ariving, people are starting to argue over
     who actually owns the storm water and that is a fascinating
     debate. You can imagine the local council saying: 'it's ours' and
     the sewerage treatment authority saying: 'no, it's ours'. There's
     a lot of detail been actually sorted out in law as well as in the
     environmental management bill. A fascinating area.
